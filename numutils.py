def fit_plane(points):
    """
    Fit points to an equation of a plane using singular value decompositon.

    We aim to find the parameters (a, b, c) in the equation of a plane: 
    `ax + by + c = z`. We can do this by setting up a system of linear
    equations: `AX = B`, where `A` is an (N, 3) array whose first two columns
    are the `x` and `y` data, `X` is a (3, 1) array containing the parameters
    to fit (a, b, c), and `B` is an (N, 1) array containing the `z` data. We
    solve by taking the generalised inverse: 

        `X = ginv(A) @ B = inv(A.T @ A) @ A.T @ B`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : ndarray of shape (3, N)

    Returns
    -------
    tupe of (fit, mean)
        fit : ndarray of shape (3,)
            Contains the fitted plane parameters (a, b, c)
        mean : ndarray of shape (3, 1)
            The position mean of the points.
